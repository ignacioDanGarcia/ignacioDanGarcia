#### ðŸ”­ At present, Iâ€™m working on enhance my github profile in general. I started to learn a lot, and upload all the files so other people can see what IÂ´m capable of.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Superior Technician in Computer Systems (second year out of three)

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m actively seeking to collaborate on a work environment that can magnify my experience. As a result, my efforts led me to secure a position of Software Engineer Jr. at NTT DATA.

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **C++, Java, Python or PL/SQL**
